## 🎯 Use Case Selector

Choose your project type to get tailored library recommendations.

### **1. Dashboards & BI**
For standard business dashboards and reporting applications.
- **Recharts** — Composable API, easy to use in React. (Tech: **SVG**)
- **MUI X Charts** — Best choice if you already use Material UI. (Tech: **SVG**)

### **2. High-Performance Visualization**
For real-time data, large datasets, or complex animations.
- **Apache ECharts** — Flexible rendering (Canvas & SVG), high performance.  
- **Lightweight Charts** — Specialized for financial/stock data, very fast. (Tech: **Canvas**)

### **3. Custom Visualizations**
For unique, bespoke charts with absolute design control.
- **visx** — Low-level toolkit built on D3 for complete customization. (Tech: **SVG / D3**)
- **nivo** — Rich customizable charts with D3 power and ease. (Tech: **SVG, Canvas, HTML**)

## 🖥 Core Rendering Technologies

### **SVG**
- ✅ High Interactivity — DOM elements are event-friendly.
- ✅ Resolution Independent — Scales without pixelation.
- ❌ Slows with thousands of elements.

### **Canvas**
- ✅ High Performance — Handles large datasets easily.
- ✅ Pixel-level Control — Great for image editing/effects.
- ❌ Requires manual click detection for shapes.

### **WebGL**
- ✅ GPU Accelerated — Best for complex scenes.
- ✅ 3D Ready — Standard for 3D web graphics.
- ❌ Requires advanced graphics programming.

## ✏ Drawing & Annotation Tools

### **Top Recommendation: `react-konva`**
- **Tech:** Canvas  
- **Best For:**
  - Feature-rich drawing editors.
  - Drag-and-drop interactions.
  - High-performance animations.

### **Specialized Tool: `polygon-annotation`**
- **Tech:** SVG-like  
- **Best For:**
  - AI/ML data labeling.
  - Annotating objects in images/videos.
  - Built-in undo/redo, vertex drag-and-drop.

## 🧠 Notes on Image Segmentation

Automated pixel-level segmentation is **computationally intensive**.  
Recommendation: **Server-side processing** — send the image from React to a backend API (e.g., Python) to run ML models and return results.
